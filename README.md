# Alien Invasion

### Description

Given a config file, this simulation generates a map with interconnected cities in which aliens will take turns to move from one place to another.

On each turn, each alien will randomly pick a neighbor city and move there. If they find that other alien is already in that city, a fight will take place and both the aliens and the city will be destroyed as a result.

When a city is destroyed, it is removed from the map, and so are any roads that lead into or out of it.

Once a city is destroyed, aliens can no longer travel to or through it. This may lead to aliens getting "trapped".

The command line argument `n` determines how many aliens are generated and placed randomly on the map.

### Events

```
ðŸš· Alien 1 is trapped forever in Gerli
